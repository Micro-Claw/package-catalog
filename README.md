# Community package catalog

MicroClaw does not test or support packages. Each package is its publisher's;
report problems using its issues URL. Intake checks provenance and release data
without executing publisher code.

The commands below come with MicroClaw. Clone it, install the two libraries
they need, and run them from inside that folder (PowerShell or any shell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Micro-Claw/microclaw
cd microclaw
python -m pip install cryptography packaging
```

**Not open yet:** the catalog's production policy is not published, so every
submission to `main` is refused until it is.

Generate your private key, keep it secret, and send the printed public key entry
and your publisher name to the catalog operator for admission:

```powershell
python -m microclaw.catalog_intake keygen --out publisher-private.pem
```

After admission, build your release zip with its manifest's artifact field set
to the exact HTTPS download URL. Sign it:

```powershell
python -m microclaw.catalog_intake sign-release --key publisher-private.pem --artifact package.zip --url https://example.org/package.zip --out release.json
```

The command prints the repository path: `releases/<publisher>/<package_id>/<version>.json`.
Fork this repository and open a PR adding just that file. Intake verifies the
signature, current policy, downloaded digest, zip structure, declared assets,
manifest binding and supported executable format. It does not run the worker.
A new version is required for a second release. Accepted PRs merge automatically;
refused PRs receive a comment naming the field to correct.

To permanently withdraw a release, sign its full identity:

```powershell
python -m microclaw.catalog_intake sign-withdrawal --key publisher-private.pem --release release.json --reason "Publisher withdrew this release" --out withdrawal.json
```

Add only the printed `withdrawals/<publisher>/<package_id>/<version>.json` path
in a new PR. Withdrawals retain the release's history. Publishers cannot edit
policy, catalog, workflows or other repository files. Production submissions go
to `main`; fixture traffic belongs only on `test`.
